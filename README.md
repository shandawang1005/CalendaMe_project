## Technical Implementation Details

### Event Creation and Validation

- **Frontend:**

  - The event creation form includes validations for title length, start and end times, and participant limits. The frontend ensures that users are guided through an error-free process.

  ```javascript
  const validateForm = () => {
    const newErrors = {};
    if (!formData.title.trim()) {
      newErrors.title = "Title is required.";
    } else if (formData.title.length > 50) {
      newErrors.title = "Title cannot exceed 50 characters.";
    }
    if (!formData.start_time) {
      newErrors.start_time = "Start time is required.";
    }
    if (!formData.end_time) {
      newErrors.end_time = "End time is required.";
    } else if (new Date(formData.end_time) <= new Date(formData.start_time)) {
      newErrors.end_time = "End time must be after start time.";
    }
    return newErrors;
  };
 - The event display on daily event calendar page.Split up 

  ```javascript
  const validateForm = () => {
    const newErrors = {};
    if (!formData.title.trim()) {
      newErrors.title = "Title is required.";
    } else if (formData.title.length > 50) {
      newErrors.title = "Title cannot exceed 50 characters.";
    }
    if (!formData.start_time) {
      newErrors.start_time = "Start time is required.";
    }
    if (!formData.end_time) {
      newErrors.end_time = "End time is required.";
    } else if (new Date(formData.end_time) <= new Date(formData.start_time)) {
      newErrors.end_time = "End time must be after start time.";
    }
    return newErrors;
  };


- **Backend:**
  - Flask handles data validation, storage, and retrieval using SQLAlchemy, ensuring data consistency and security.

### Real-Time Chat

- **WebSocket Implementation:**
  - The app leverages Socket.IO for real-time communication. Users are notified of new messages instantly, and the chat history is efficiently managed in the backend.

### Responsive Design

- **Media Queries:**
  - CSS3 media queries ensure that the application adapts to different screen sizes, providing an optimal user experience on both mobile and desktop devices.

## Challenges Faced

### WebSocket Integration:

- Implementing real-time communication using WebSockets was challenging but rewarding. Ensuring that messages were delivered and displayed correctly across all connected clients required careful consideration.

### Data Validation:

- Balancing between front-end and back-end validations to ensure data integrity while maintaining a responsive user experience was another key challenge.
